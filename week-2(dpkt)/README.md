# Week 2
This folder contains the relevant code for week 2 discussions. The *dpkt-demo.py* file contains a very simple command line tool that you can run to print HTTP request and response information from a Packet Capture (.pcap) file.

To run the command line tool, use the following command:

```
python3 dpkt-demo.py <filename.pcap>
```

The *discussion-demo.py* file contains code explained in the discussion session.

Feel free to make changes and experiment with all that dpkt has to offer. 

## Happy Coding!
